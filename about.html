              <p>My name is Samuel Thomas Hinkhouse. I was born on November 24th, 1995 in Muscatine, Iowa. Muscatine, Iowa is based in South-East Iowa right next to the legendary Mississippi River. I am the baby in our family. I have two older brothers and a sister whom is married. My oldest brother, Zach, is thirty-two years old. He works at a factory called GPC in Muscatine. My brother Zach is (recently) engaged to Susan. Susan has had no trouble fitting into our family and we consider her a member already. My other brother, Tyler, is twenty-six years old. He is the lead bus driver at Louisa-Muscatine Community School District, my former high school. My only sister, Holly, is thirty-four years old. She is a graduate of IUPUI in Indianapolis with a degree in Sociology.</p>
              <p>As for me, I am a graduate of Louisa-Muscatine Jr./Sr. High School with honors. During my time in high school, I was in track, cheerleading, and choir. My senior year, I was choir president and captain of our Varsity basketball cheerleading squad. In addition, I was also an intern under the Technology Director at L-M for three years. I would assist him in solving various issues that would arise with the district's technology. I am currently a junior at Graceland University. I am majoring in Computer Science Information Technology with a minor in Web Design. I have always been immensely passionate about technology and also design. Ideally in the future, I want to be a software engineer or a user experience designer. I think that it is important to provide users with a great user experience when it comes to programming. I want to help companies provide a great product for their customers by making a program that is user friendly.</p>
