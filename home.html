		<p>Hey everyone, I'm back with more updates. Today was my first day of my senior year of college at Graceland University. It feels surreal to think it is my last year. My class load is much lighter than it has been
		in previous semesters, freeing me up for more leadership positions and more projects to focus on. For the last month, I have been working on a project in my home county. The democratic chairman of Louisa County asked me to
build a website for the <a href="https://www.louisacountydems.org">Louisa County Democrats</a>. Last week, we launched the website and had many people sign up to receive email updates, and donated to the party. It has been successful so far. In addition,
I have recently taken over the Graceland Intramurals website, which has the ability to add and remove games, rosters, schedule events, and more. This year, I am the President of our ACM Chapter, helping plan events, meetings, computing conferences, and other activities. I'm also involved with the cheerleading team again this year.
I'm really looking forward to an exciting senior year. In the mean time, take a look at the projects I'm working on, I will have more and more to come as well as updates to past projects. Thanks for checking my website!</p>

		<p>It's been almost a year since I have composed a new post on the home page of my website. As it turns out, blogging isn't really my thing. 
		Regardless, here is an update on my life. Since the last time I posted, I have finished another year at Graceland University, making the next year of my bachelor's degree my last. It has 
		flown by. Being at Graceland has been one of the best years of my life thus far. Over the past year, I have made a lot of progress as a designer and a programmer. I have made more quality projects, learned more languages, advanced techniques, and finished a senior project. 
		</p>
		<p>I am currently interning at Smith & Associates for the second time. We are continuing where we left off on our project from last year.
		So far, a lot of our work has focused on improving UI features and smashing bugs on the front end and back end. The plan is to finish Partmatch and add it to the system
		at the end of the internship. It has been a fun project so far and I'm looking forward to finishing it. Lastly, the title of this post, "Borborygmus" is a random word I found.
		It is the scientific name for a stomach rumble. I thought it was interesting. I'll try to post a bit more frequently from now on. Until then, "wake me when you need me".</p>

        <p>Hello everyone! It's been awhile since I have posted a new post on my website. Our web server at Graceland has been rejecting people from logging on to the server 
        so I had to move my website over to a new hosting service for the time being. There are a couple of new things. The first new thing you'll notice is that I have a domain now. 
        Github has a student package for college students that provides a number of free services to students... one of them being a free domain for a year. The other new change is that I have made a new design to the website.
        Now that I am back at school, I would like to dedicate more time to updating my website. This website will have more frequent blog posts as well as links to projects I've been working on. I hope that you will check them out as I update the site.</p>
        <p>
          I recently started back at Graceland for my junior year of college. I am taking a couple of design classes for my Web Design major and a few classes for my Computer Science major 
          including Operating Systems and Networking, PHP Programming, and Systems Analysis and Design. I have also started to do cheerleading again. I was a cheerleader in high school and I found myself really missing being apart of it. 
          I am also the treasurer and secretary of the ACM chapter on campus. I am really looking forward to planning fun activities for Computer Science students and competing in programming contests this year.

        <p>For the last two weeks, I have been in Houston for an internship with Smith & Associates. During my time there, I have been working on learning some new programming languages. I have been learning some intermediate JavaScript techniques. I have
          also been learning how to use AngularJS. I have been completing tutorials on JavaScript and AngularJS. </p>
        <p>Using what I've learned, I have made some mini projects which will be uploaded soon. I have also been using this knowledge to update my website. The front end (the part you see) has remained mostly untouched. But I have been making changes to
          the back end of the website to make it run on one page. In addition, I have started to store the content from this website onto a database. The content on the homepage loads straight from a database. I have also created a web page that allows
          me to write to the database and post content to the website immediately. This has made content management more seamless. </p>
        <p>Besides my new coding tricks, I have been having a lot of fun with friends here in Houston. We have went to a lot of great restaurants here in Houston and we went to a water park on Saturday! Smith has a lot of fun activities planned for the summer.
          I am looking forward to the rest of the summer that lies ahead. Stay tuned for more updates!</p>

        <p>On Saturday and Sunday, I made the voyage from my home in Iowa to my new home in Texas for the next seven weeks. I am staying in a hotel near the center of Houston for an internship with Smith & Associates. I don't officially start my internship
          until Wednesday June 1st. I thought it would be a good opportunity to familarize myself with the city a little bit before I started working.</p>
        <p>One thing I noticed while driving through Texas the past couple days is that driving here can be a bit overwhelming! There were two times where I had a driver pull out in front of me, nearly causing me to crash into them. Being in the middle of
          Houston, there is a lot of traffic coming and going. It is very fast paced and it can be a bit overwhelming at times. In Iowa, the roads are mostly one lane on either side of the road, with some of the highways being two lane on either side.
          That is the type of roads I am used to. In Houston, there are roads with as many as six lanes on either side.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow, I start working at Smith & Associates. Smith & Associates provides electronic components to electronics manufacturers. I will be writing a search function for their internal enterprise trading platform. It is going to be a great experience
          coding something that will be used by many people.</p>

        <p>Welcome to my newly designed website! Over the past couple of weeks, I have been working on giving my website a new design. I finally got around to finishing the ground work so that I could post it. The goal of this website is to promote myself.
          This website will tell you more about me and what I am passionate about. It will also give you some insight on my experiences and some projects I have worked on. Feel free to explore. Thank you for visiting.</p>
