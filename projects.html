<p>In late July, I was asked to build a website for the Louisa County Democratic Party of Iowa to increase their brand, promote democratic ideals and candidates, set up a email newsletter system, and lead users to donate and register to vote in Iowa.</p>
                    <p><a href="http://alt.graceland.edu/~samuel1/GU4U">GU4U</a></p>
                    <p>This project was made during my senior Systems Development Project class. GU4U is a mentoring program for students at Graceland
                        University. This website allows them to sign up to get a mentor and receive career help.</p>

                                As a summer sideproject, I made this chatroom application. So far, it allows a user to sign in or create a new user to access the chatrooms. There is currently a list of chatrooms
								that a user can choose from. The user selects a chatroom and can send a message to users in the room. The message gets sent to a database and returns the sent message along with an
								update of the chatroom. The chatroom updates periodically. My main focus with this project is becoming more familar with server-side technology, database management, and security.
								In the future, possible features may include adding a new chatroom, chatroom management, user administration, displaying active users, emoticons, image and video processing, and more.

                            <p>This website allows you to view the weather via DarkSky's weather API and pulls the API through a proxy. Similar to my first attempt, this website allows you
                                to get the seven day forecast. This new version allows you to get the current weather with detailed information, warnings and alerts, an hour-by-hour forecast,
								all from the location your in using Google Maps Geolocation APIs. In addition, there is now the capability to search for a location.</p>

                                For my JavaScript class, I had to make a number of projects and one of them was a calculator. This calculator allows the user to chain together operations.

                                For the past year, off and on I have been working on programming skills through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/">FreeCodeCamp</a>. It's a great website to
                                brush up on your programming skills and do some projects along the way. You can find links to my programming progress and projects below:

                                I believe in the power of positive affirmations. Sometimes when I'm struggling to get through the day, reading affirmations makes things a little better.
                                This website allows the user to click on the button to load a random affirmation and changes the background color from an array of colors.

                        <p>For my PHP class, I had to make a fast food website that would allow a user to sign up and see the food we offer. I also made a admin portal that allowed the manager
                            to add food and ingredients to the menu.</p>
