          <p>Currently, I am a asenior at Graceland University in Lamoni, Iowa. I am expected to graduate in May of 2018. I have a GPA of 3.86. I have been on the Honor Roll every semester at Graceland.
            I am pursuing my Bachelor's of Science with a double major in Computer Science &amp; Information Technology and Web Design. During my time at Graceland University, I have been in both concert choir and chamber choir. During my second year
            of college, I was on the Academic Student Council. I was voted in as a member of the Advisory Council for the Academic Student Council. I assist a small group of house representative with coordinating and planning activities for students during
            the school year. I am a member of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Chapter on campus. We go to computing contests and compete in programming and robotics contests each year. For the past two years, I have been Ackerley Scholar. The Ackerley
            Scholar's attend weekly ACM meetings, go to programming contests, participate in service projects, and present scholarly work at Graceland's annual Scholar's Showcase Day each Spring. Starting my junior year of college, I have been apart of our school's cheerleading squad.
          I participate in football, basketball, and competition cheerleading. I am also serving as the treasurer of ACM.</p>

		  <h3>Musco Lighting; Muscatine, IA</h3>
          <h4>May 2015 to August 2015, May 2016</h4>
          <p>During my time at Musco Lighting, I worked in the factory putting together brackets and plates for power devices. I assembled surge protection devices and built yokes and cones. I made and tested wire harnesses as well.</p>

          <h3>InfoCentral Student Technology Assistant; Lamoni, IA</h3>
          <h4>August 2014 to May 2016</h4>
          <p>During my time at Graceland University, I worked for InfoCentral at Graceland University. I assist student and faculty by fixing faulty cabling in projector carts, repairing student computers, setting up projectors, televisions, digital signage

          <h3>Louisa Muscatine CSD Technology Internship; Letts, IA</h3>
          <h4>August 2012 to July 2014</h4>
          <p>During my time as a high school student, I took part in an internship program in the technology department in my school district. I reported directly to the technology director each day to find out what my assignment would be. I would go around
            to both school buildings and service computers. I often took control in reimaging Mac desktop labs, Windows desktop labs, and Mac and Windows mobile labs. In addition, I would diagnose student and teacher's issues with technology on campus
            and provide them with solutions to problems they were facing. I constructed PDF documents that would provide a step-by-step instruction manual on how to perform certain intermediate tasks on the computer and provided various creative methods
            that could be used with technology in the classroom. If the technology director was busy working on another issue, it was my job to step up and offer my assistance. I was also the student representative to the District and High School Technology
            Committee's. I advised the committees on what direction I thought the school's should go in with their available funding.</p>
